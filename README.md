## Overview

Iridium is your favorite benevolent Discord bot, made to be as abstract and expansive as possible. All features on Iridium are modular, which means any feature, setting and corresponding command can be disabled by a server owner. This repository primarily exists as transparency for the bot's codebase, rather than being something that you (the viewer) can self-host. You are not expected to host and maintain your own instance of this bot, and are completely fine to use the provided version used in production!

If you would like to contribute, you are much free to do so as you please! Just please make sure to follow any contribution guideline that we may have. Right now, we are in a very early stage of development.

**Primarily**, we hope to eventually have her be able to:
* have an easy interface server owners can utilize to modify the settings of the bot;
* have a wide array of commands and modules owners can play with at will;
* have many useful tools available at the disposal of a server owner;
* support and integrate many popular games and communities played across the internet;
* have good coverage over virtually every field when it comes to Discord bots;
* and have a complete arsenal of extensibility to make Iridium much more worth using.

## Contributions

If you would like to contribute to the project, **please** inform a developer via. an issue that describes what you're working on or trying to implement; or ask to be assigned a task from one of the open issues! You can also do this over our discord server. You also need to know how to reasonably work on a bot.

### Requirements

* Node.js v18
* PostgreSQL v12
* OpenAI developer account (you can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com))

### Support

All development should be resolved and curated over our [issue tracker](https://github.com/iridiumbot/iridium), but all bot support questions should be made over our [discord](https://discord.gg/muDnFVwhUq).
